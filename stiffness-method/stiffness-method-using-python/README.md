# Stiffness method using Python
Author: Nophi


This repository contains the python codes or script I used to demonstrate on how to perform stiffness method using python programming. The following scripts are presented:

- [Stiffness method for axial springs](https://github.com/nophibiton/Struct_Engg/blob/main/stiffness-method/stiffness-method-using-python/stiffness_method_axial_springs.ipynb)
- [Stiffness method for 2D truss](https://github.com/nophibiton/Struct_Engg/blob/main/stiffness-method/stiffness-method-using-python/stiffness_method_trusses2d.ipynb)
